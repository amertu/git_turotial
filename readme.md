Learning of the technologies (spring boot und angular) is included in the workload list.
The workload of techstories is added in the corresponding userstories.

I already started to learn the technologies during February; otherwise it would not be possible to do all the workload.
I am very thankful to xy for making it possible to do the initial test later because of my illness.

Since I started with my MA coming from another university and another field, this lecture is a prerequisite for me to be able to start with my MA thesis.
